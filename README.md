Marshalls Revenue Forecasting Application
Overview:
Built a C# console application that simulates revenue forecasting for a service-based business. The application transforms operational job volume inputs into projected financial outputs using structured pricing logic and conditional analysis.

Key Functionality:
Captures projected interior and exterior service volume via console input
Implements pricing model:
Interior murals → $500/unit
Exterior murals → $750/unit

Calculates:
Revenue by service category
Total projected revenue
Performs comparative service distribution analysis using conditional logic
Outputs formatted business insights to the console
